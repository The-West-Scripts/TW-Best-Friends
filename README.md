# Better-TW-Friends
A game modification (Userscript) for InnoGames' browser game called "The-West". Why is it better than the previous one? Well the previous version used to send a request to the servers every 2 minutes, causing server and client-side lag.

As of August of 2017 I (xShteff) am no longer in charge of updating the script. If you want to be in charge of it feel free to make a pull request and I will approve it as soon as I'm available.
